# Design Document

## Overview

The markdown-to-html-slides system is designed as a multi-stage processing pipeline that transforms markdown content through five distinct phases, each corresponding to one of the input files (01-05). The system follows a content-driven approach where each stage builds upon the previous one, ultimately producing high-quality, interactive HTML slides that maintain professional presentation standards.

The architecture emphasizes modularity, allowing each processing stage to be independently tested and modified while maintaining the overall workflow integrity. The system implements the proven methodologies documented in the source files, including the 80-minute draft creation philosophy, 25 presentation patterns, Marp expression guidelines, and HTML optimization techniques.

## Architecture

### System Architecture Overview

The system follows a sequential processing model where each stage transforms the content according to specific methodologies:

1. **Idea Analysis Stage**: Extracts core concepts and applies critical thinking framework
2. **Draft Structure Stage**: Implements 4 essential elements and 3-5-1 information rule  
3. **Pattern Selection Stage**: Chooses optimal presentation patterns from 25 available options
4. **Marp Generation Stage**: Creates Marp-compatible markdown with proper layouts
5. **HTML Conversion Stage**: Generates responsive, accessible HTML with interactive features

### Processing Pipeline

The processing pipeline consists of five sequential stages:

- **Input**: 5 markdown files (01-05) processed in order
- **Stage 1**: Idea analysis and framework extraction
- **Stage 2**: Draft structure implementation
- **Stage 3**: Presentation pattern selection
- **Stage 4**: Marp markdown generation
- **Stage 5**: HTML conversion with interactive features
- **Output**: Professional HTML slideshow

## Components and Interfaces

### Core Components

#### 1. FileProcessor
Handles input file processing and validation:
- Processes files in correct order (01-05)
- Extracts content and metadata from each file
- Validates file structure and content format
- Maintains processing state across stages

#### 2. StageProcessor
Manages individual processing stages:
- **IdeaAnalysisProcessor**: Extracts critical thinking framework and key principles
- **DraftStructureProcessor**: Implements 4 essential elements and overview statements
- **PatternSelectionProcessor**: Analyzes content and selects optimal presentation patterns
- **MarpGenerationProcessor**: Creates Marp-compatible slides with proper layouts
- **HTMLConversionProcessor**: Generates responsive HTML with interactive features

#### 3. ContentAnalyzer
Analyzes content to determine optimal presentation approach:
- Identifies content types (numerical, structural, temporal, organizational, experiential)
- Maps content to appropriate presentation patterns
- Determines layout requirements and constraints
- Validates content against slide limitations

#### 4. TemplateEngine
Manages slide templates and layouts:
- Provides 11 layout patterns (standard, split, center, grid, etc.)
- Applies consistent styling and design system
- Handles responsive design implementation
- Manages template customization and theming

#### 5. HTMLGenerator
Creates final HTML output:
- Converts Marp slides to HTML structure
- Implements interactive navigation features
- Applies accessibility enhancements
- Optimizes performance and loading

### Interface Definitions

#### Core Processing Interface
```typescript
interface ProcessingPipeline {
  processFiles(files: MarkdownFile[]): HTMLSlideshow;
  validateInput(files: MarkdownFile[]): ValidationResult;
  getProcessingStatus(): ProcessingStatus;
}

interface MarkdownFile {
  path: string;
  content: string;
  stage: number;
}

interface HTMLSlideshow {
  slides: HTMLSlide[];
  navigation: NavigationComponent;
  styling: StyleSheet;
  metadata: SlideshowMetadata;
}
```

#### Content Processing Interface
```typescript
interface ContentProcessor {
  analyzeContent(content: string): ContentAnalysis;
  selectPatterns(analysis: ContentAnalysis): PresentationPattern[];
  generateSlides(content: string, patterns: PresentationPattern[]): SlideDefinition[];
}

interface SlideDefinition {
  title: string;
  overviewStatement: string;
  content: SlideContent;
  layout: LayoutType;
  styling: StyleOptions;
}
```

## Data Models

### Content Models

#### ProcessedContent
Represents content at each processing stage:
- **Stage 1**: Idea framework with principles and evaluation criteria
- **Stage 2**: Draft structure with essential elements and information hierarchy
- **Stage 3**: Presentation mapping with selected patterns and content types
- **Stage 4**: Marp slides with layouts and styling
- **Stage 5**: HTML output with interactive features

#### SlideContent
Defines individual slide structure:
- Title and overview statement (required)
- Content sections with appropriate formatting
- Layout pattern and responsive behavior
- Interactive elements and navigation
- Accessibility features and metadata

### Configuration Models

#### DesignSystem
Defines visual design standards:
- Color palette (primary, secondary, neutral, semantic)
- Typography scale (font sizes, weights, line heights)
- Spacing system (margins, padding, gaps)
- Responsive breakpoints and behavior

#### LayoutConfiguration
Manages slide layouts and patterns:
- 16:9 aspect ratio enforcement
- Safe area definitions and constraints
- Grid system configuration
- Layout pattern templates and rules

## Error Handling

### Error Categories

#### File Processing Errors
- Missing or corrupted input files
- Invalid file order or naming
- Content encoding or format issues
- Metadata extraction failures

#### Content Processing Errors
- Invalid markdown syntax
- Missing required elements (title, overview, etc.)
- Content length exceeding slide limits
- Pattern selection failures

#### Output Generation Errors
- Marp generation failures
- HTML conversion issues
- Validation failures
- Accessibility compliance violations

### Recovery Strategies

#### Graceful Degradation
- Fall back to simpler layouts if complex patterns fail
- Use static alternatives if interactive features fail
- Apply basic styling if advanced theming fails
- Provide minimal viable output for critical failures

#### Content Correction
- Automatic content splitting for oversized slides
- Missing element insertion with default values
- Format correction for invalid markdown
- Pattern fallbacks for unsupported content types

#### Validation and Quality Assurance
- Pre-processing validation of input files
- Stage-by-stage content validation
- Output quality verification
- Accessibility compliance checking

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Individual component testing for each processor
- Content analysis and pattern selection validation
- Template generation and layout testing
- HTML output and styling verification

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end pipeline processing
- Data flow integrity across stages
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Cross-stage compatibility validation

### Quality Assurance
- Output quality validation (no overflow, proper formatting)
- Accessibility compliance testing (WCAG guidelines)
- Performance testing (load times, responsiveness)
- Cross-browser compatibility verification

### User Acceptance Testing
- Professional presentation quality assessment
- Content readability and comprehension
- Navigation and interactive feature usability
- Overall user experience evaluation

### Automated Testing Pipeline
- Continuous integration with automated test suites
- Visual regression testing for layout consistency
- Performance benchmarking and monitoring
- Accessibility auditing and compliance reporting

This design provides a comprehensive framework for transforming markdown content into professional HTML slides through a systematic, multi-stage approach that ensures quality, accessibility, and usability.
